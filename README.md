### **Basic Git Concepts**

1. **Repository (Repo)**
   A project folder that Git is tracking. Can be
   **local** (on your computer) or **remote** (Like Github)
2. **Version Control**
   A system that tracks changes to code over time, letting you revert to previous versios or collaborate with others.
3. **Commit**
   A snapshot of your changes. Including a
   message describing what changed.
4. **Working Directory**
   The current state of you files on
   disk.
5. **Staging Area**
   Where you prepare changes before
   commiting. You "stage" files that are
   ready to be commited.

### **Common Commands**

6. `git init`
   Initializes a new Git repository in a folder.
7. `git status`
   Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area
8. `git add <file>`
   Stages changes in a file for the next commit.
9. `git commit -m "message"`
   Saves the staged changes with a commit message
10. `git push`
    Sends local commits to the remote repository.
    **Note**: You may need to first create a repo in github, and use `add origin` to link your local repo to the remote one.
11. `git pull`
    Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to your local one.
12. `git fetch`
    Downloads changes from the remote, but doesn't merge them automatically
